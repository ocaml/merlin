  [inspect_browse_tree lid ~cursor mbrowse] tries to provide contextual
  information given the selected identifier, the position of the cursor and the
  typed tree. It is used by Locate and Type_enclosing.

  The cursor position is used to distinguished wether a module path or an actual
  constructor name is pointed at when the cursor is in the middle of a
  longident, e.g. [Foo.B|ar.Constructor] (with | being the cursor).

  FIXME: when cursor at (M.|A 3), the enclosing node returned is const 3, thus
  breaking the context inference.
