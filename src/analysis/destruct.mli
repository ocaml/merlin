(** Destruct at the moment works in two contexts:

      - an expression context:
          It will replace the expression [e] under the cursor with

          {[
            match e with
            | p1 -> failwith "TODO"
            | ...
          ]}

          This matching will be exhaustive.

          If [e] has a "package" type, it will be replaced by
          [let module M = (val e) in failwith "TODO"]

      - a pattern context:
          Here two differents behaviors can be observed:
          + if your matching is not exhaustive, it will be made exhaustive.
          + if your matching is exhaustive, it will refine the subpattern under
            the cursor if possible (i.e. if your cursor is on a variable or _ ).


                                * * *


    Final remarks:
      - Destruct will refuse to work on expression (resp. patterns) with a
        functionnal or polymorphic type.

      - Constructors of variant types will be prefixed by their path (if
        necessary) but record labels will not.
        The reason is that we don't control the way things are printed, we reuse
        [Pprintast] which will print things like:
        [{ Module.label1 = label1 ; Module.label2 = label2}] where one would
        rather have [{ Module.label1 ; label2 }]. Since qualifying one label is
        less annoying than rewriting the whole pattern, we decided to note
        qualify labels (understanding that the code inserted by merlin in the
        buffer will sometimes be wrong).

val node : loc:Location.t -> Browse_node.t -> Browse_node.t list -> Location.t * string
(** [node ~loc ~env parents current_node] returns a location indicating which
    portion of the buffer must be replaced and the string to replace it with. *)
