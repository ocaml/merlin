(* A longident can have the form: A.B.x Right now we are only interested in
   values, but we will eventually want to index all occurrences of modules in
   such longidents. However there is an issue with that: we only have the
   location of the complete longident which might span multiple lines. This is
   enough to get the last component since it will always be on the last line,
   but will prevent us to find the location of previous components.

   However, we can safely deduce the location of the last part of the lid only
   when the ident does not require parenthesis. In that case the loc sie differs
   from the name size in a way that depends on the concrete syntax which is
