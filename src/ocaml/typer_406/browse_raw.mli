(** [Browse_node] offers a uniform interface to traverse constructions from
  * [TypedTree].
  *
  * Mutually recursive types from [TypedTree] are wrapped into different
  * constructors of the type [node].
  * Then the [fold] function traverses one-level of sub-nodes.
  *
  * In the meantime, the most specific environment and location are threaded
  * (FIXME: should these two be managed separately?).
  *
  * Finally [BrowseT] module a node into a tree which structure mimics
  * the recursive structure of the [TypedTree] node.
