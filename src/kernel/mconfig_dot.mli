    and its parent directories. Stopping on the first one it finds and returning
    a configuration context along with the path to the configuration file,
    returning None otherwise (if '/' was reached without finding such a file).

    A project configuration files is one of:
    - .merlin
    - dune-project
    - dune-workspace

    They are detected in that order. [dune] and [jbuild] file do not need to be taken into account because any project using a recent version of dune should have a dune-project file which is even auto-generated when it is missing. And only recent versions of dune will stop writing .merlin files.
