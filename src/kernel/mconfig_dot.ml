         Most processes spawned by merlin are supposed to inherit stderr to
         output their debug information. This is fine because these processes
         are short-lived.
         However the dune helper we are about to spawn is long-lived, which can
         cause issues with inherited descriptors because it will outlive
         merlin's client process.
         This is not an issue under Unix because file descriptors are replaced
         (stdin/out/err are new), but under Windows, handle can accumulate.
         This makes emacs block, synchronously waiting for the inherited (but
         unused) stdout/stderr to be closed.
