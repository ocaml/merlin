val fatal_error: string -> 'a

exception Fatal_error of string * Printexc.raw_backtrace

val try_finally :
  ?always:(unit -> unit) ->
  ?exceptionally:(unit -> unit) ->
  (unit -> 'a) -> 'a
(** [try_finally work ~always ~exceptionally] is designed to run code
    in [work] that may fail with an exception, and has two kind of
    cleanup routines: [always], that must be run after any execution
    of the function (typically, freeing system resources), and
    [exceptionally], that should be run only if [work] or [always]
    failed with an exception (typically, undoing user-visible state
    changes that would only make sense if the function completes
    correctly). For example:

    {[
      let objfile = outputprefix ^ ".cmo" in
      let oc = open_out_bin objfile in
      Misc.try_finally
        (fun () ->
           bytecode
           ++ Timings.(accumulate_time (Generate sourcefile))
               (Emitcode.to_file oc modulename objfile);
           Warnings.check_fatal ())
        ~always:(fun () -> close_out oc)
        ~exceptionally:(fun _exn -> remove_file objfile);
    ]}

    If [exceptionally] fail with an exception, it is propagated as
    usual.

    If [always] or [exceptionally] use exceptions internally for
    control-flow but do not raise, then [try_finally] is careful to
    preserve any exception backtrace coming from [work] or [always]
    for easier debugging.
