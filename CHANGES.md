    - new "polarity search" feature: provides a Hoogle-like type-based search
      for libraries that are in merlin's scope.
      See https://github.com/ocaml/merlin/blob/master/doc/features.md#polarity-search

    - spell-checking: a simple spell-checker has been added to suggest
      corrections when nothing can be directly completed.
    - type-driven record completion: merlin will now make use of type
      information from the context for narrowing and refining completion
      candidates.
    - support for `#require` directive in a source file, and will treat it as a
      package use
    - Add support for OCaml 4.07

merlin 3.0.2
============
Wed Aug  2 15:09:07 CEST 2017

Bug fix after 3.0.1:
- CMT magic number for 4.05 was wrong
- handle merlin.focus, merlin.ignore, merlin.loc/merlin.relaxed-loc and merlin.syntax-error
- missing include preventing build on some platforms contributed by Bernhard Schommer

merlin 3.0.1
============
Wed Jul 26 18:25:23 CEST 2017

Bug fix release after 3.0.0 major release:
- portability fixes by David Allsop in configure script and vim mode
  (tough Windows support is not ready yet)
- preliminary support for findlib toolchains with FINDLIB_TOOLCHAIN .merlin
  directive
- make ocamlmerlin.c frontend more portable
- various fixes to the frontend

merlin 3.0.0
============
Mon Jul 24 11:21:58 CEST 2017

The major change is a new protocol that moves process management inside Merlin
codebase, saving a lot of pain in Emacs and Vim. There are not much new user
facing features.

Windows support is not yet available.

In editor configuration is now done with merlin-flags, merlin-extensions and
merlin-use in Emacs and :MerlinFlags, :MerlinExtensions and :MerlinPackages in
Vim.
In previous versions, enabled extensions, flags and packages were retained
while now only the last command is remembered.

"M-x merlin-use a", "M-x merlin-use b" should be replaced by "M-x merlin-use a,b".
":MerlinUse a", ":MerlinUse b" should be replaced by ":MerlinUse a b".

The old protocol is still supported, so existing editor modes should not be
affected (tested with Atom, Visual Studio and Sublime-text).

Other main changes:
- Support for OCaml 4.05 was added
- Merlin uses a new implementation of short-path by Leo White which addresses
  performance problems
- Merlin now works with the upstream version of Menhir
- numerous cleanup and refactoring to decrease the amount of changes to
  upstream typechecker
- emacs-imenu feature was contributed by tddsg. It is similar the "outline"
  feature in vim for navigating in a buffer.

Thanks to the many contributors (Jochen Bartl, tddsg, Ximin Luo, Jason Staten,
Leo White, Leandro Ostera, Jacob Bass, Xavier Guérin, Yotam Barnoy, Jacques
Pascal Deplaix, David Allsopp, ...).

merlin 2.2
==========
Wed May 20 09:44:55 EDT 2015

  + backend:
    - completion
        + return the type of the expected argument when completing an
          application.
          This allows us to offer completion for named and optional parameters,
          as well as polymorphic variants
        + optionally associates ocamldoc comments to candidates
        + adds field completion inside records ( #296 )
    - locate:
        + partially rewritten, introduces a new kind of cache
          (so potentially noticeably bigger memory consumption)
        + better handling of functors
        + handle local modules
        + fix occasional "inconsistent assumptions"
    - error reporting:
        + handle environment errors (inconsistent assumptions, …)
        + filter duplicated messages
        + fix type error reporting:
            "this expression has type t = t but an expression was expected of
            type u = u"
          we now only print the equality when it adds some information
        + less noisy pattern recovery: when every pattern is recovered, consider
          that the matched expression is the the source of the problem, and
          retry typing with "'a" as the type of the matched expression.
    - add support for trunk
    - add a "document" command: takes an ident and return its documentation (if
      any)
    - destruct: use more precise environments ( #389 )
    - warnings:
        + check signature inclusion to prevent spurious warnings about unused
          declarations
        + backport 4.02-style warning management
        + add a dump command
    - nonrec: update implementation to more-or-less match the upstream one
      (upstream >= 4.02.2)
    - parser: improve marking heuristic in presence of ;; or toplevel
      directives.
    - typeof: during verbose expansion, also print the type declaration if we
      have a type constructor

  + emacs:
    - fix bindings of every completion backend
    - bind ocamldoc comments to company (optional)
    - detect race conditions when running synchronous commands
    - cleanup "merlin-process-started-p"
    - locate error messages were silently ignored, they are now printed
    - drop text properties from commands sent to merlin (pull request #383 by
      milanst)
    - Tell merlin the content of the buffer when opening a new buffer.
      This allows merlin idle-job to preload content if nothing else is
      requested.
    - remove call to merlin from the lighter

  + vim:
    - fix ctrlp binding for locate
    - add (dwim) completion on :TypeOf
    - while completing, candidates documentation can be displayed in the
      "preview" window
    - prefix every command name by "Merlin" ( #379 )
    - Tell merlin the content of the buffer when opening a new buffer.
      This allows merlin idle-job to preload content if nothing else is
      requested.

merlin 2.1.2
============
Tue Mar  3 12:20:08 UTC 2015

  Main new feature is a faster short-path, and also a lot of buxfixes.

  + backend:
    - merge new implementation of short-path
    - infrastructure for doing background computations
    - fix exhaustivity checking of GADTs
    - fix Typecore error reporting in 4.00.1 & 4.01.0
    - delayed checks are now enabled (e.g warnings)
    - special handling of "myocamlbuild.ml" (issue #363)
    - better sharing/caching of global modules
    - more customizable .merlin loading

    - Refuse/Resist... environment variables redefinition

  + vim:
    - fix charset/encoding detection (pull request #352 by rgrinberg)
    - minor fixes and simplification

  + emacs:
    - better integration with emacs error management and asynchronous handling
    - expose custom .merlin loading in merlin-grouping-function
    - fixes, printf-debugging cleanup

merlin 2.1.1
============
Wed Jan 28 08:59:20 GMT 2015

  + backend:
    - locate: merlin refused to locate things when it had no context (happens
      when the buffer didn't parse for example) claiming it was at the
      "definition point". Fixed.
    - locate: use the cmt path when no ml file was found in the source path
      (this might not be such a good idea, the cases when this work are the ones
      where the user configuration is wrong...)
    - destruct: qualify introduced constructors
    - destruct: eliminate "impossible" GADT branches
    - parser: handle '%' as an operator for 4.00 and 4.01 ( #345 )

  + fake:
    - add typerep support
    - never generate `'_` type variables.

  + vim:
    - show duplicated outlines in CtrlP
    - sort outlines by name length in CtrlP
    - when split method is set to 'tab' *always* open a new tab.

merlin 2.1
===========
Sun Jan 11 22:20:23 CET 2015

  + backend:
    - add PPX support
    - make use of context before locating (#308, #316, #318).
    - generate match patterns for arbitrary expressions and missing patterns
      for incomplete matchings (#123).
    - reintroduce type expansion (asking the times of the same expression
      several times will resolve type aliases).
    - "smart" (a.k.a "do what I mean") completion:
          `L.m` will expand to `List.map ; List.m... ; ListLabels.map ; ...` if
          `L` doesn't exist.
    - simplify incremental parser and typer interfaces
    - locate: better handling of packed modules (supposedly)
    - more precise recovery on patterns (before the recovery was done at the
      expression level, so the whole match was discarded, now only the pattern
      is)

  + emacs:
    - don't use fringe in emacs23 (broken)
    - remove obsolete aliases:
        merlin-occurences => merlin-occurrences
        merlin-to-end => merlin-error-check
    - disable merlin-mode on type buffer
    - require caml-types (needed for highlighting) (#331).

  + misc:
    - update README (#301).

  + vim:
    - add a type history buffer (#313, #322) -- only available for vim > 7.3.
    - highlight types when displaying them in the command line -- only for vim >
      7.3
    - add tab completion for the argument of the `:Locate` command
    - add support for text objects based on type enclosing
    - introduce an interactive version of `:Rename`
    - locate results can now be shown in a new or existing tab (#335)
    - use `fileencoding` where necessary (#332)
    - ctrlp bindings for outline and locate

This release also contains contributions from: Geoff Gole, Rudi Grinberg, Markus
Mottl, Roman Vorobets and Arthur Wendling.

merlin 2.0
==========
Fri Oct 31 11:04:21 CET 2014

This is a major release which we worked on for several months, rewriting many
parts of the codebase. An exhaustive list of changes is therefore impossible to
give, but here are some key points (from an user perspective):

  - support for OCaml 4.02.{0,1}
  - more precise recovery in presence of syntax errors
  - more user-friendly messages for syntax errors
  - locate now works on MLI files
  - automatic reloading of .merlin files (when they are update or created), it
    is no longer necessary to restart merlin
  - introduced a small refactoring command: rename, who renames all occurrences
    of an identifier. See: http://yawdp.com/~def/rename.webm


This release also contains contributions from: Yotam Barnoy, Jacques-Pascal
Deplaix, Geoff Gole, Rudi Grinberg, Steve Purcell and Jan Rehders.

  + backend:
    - lazy processing of open directives makes merlin much faster
    - simplified buffer management
    - tweak signal handling to improve windows compatibility
    - track verbosity of query: repeated queries are considered more "verbose"

    - add support for OUnit-like Benchmark extension
    - more tolerant type checker, to provide completion on ill-typed
      expressions
    - proper version reporting with git revision
    - refactored logging subsystem
    - add support "val constructs" in implementation: report errors but add
      definition to current environment

      to jump on its definition
    - made communication with merlin asynchronous (using transfer queues) hence
      improving responsiveness
    - when running a merlin command, the errors present in all phrases but the
      current one are displayed
    - fixed buffer cleaning
    - successive call to C-c C-t do not climb the typed tree but improve merlin's
      verbosity. To move inside the tree use C-down and C-up (which implements
      phrase movement if there is no enclosing started).
    - customize data for merlin
    - refactoring and numerous bugfixes


merlin 1.3.1
============


  Minor release, but merlin is now compatible with ocaml versions > 4.00.1.
  The only noticeable changes since 1.3 is the use of short paths even with
  version 4.00.1 of ocaml.

merlin 1.3
==========

  + backend:
