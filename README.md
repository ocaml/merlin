[Merlin](https://ocaml.github.io/merlin/) is an editor service that provides modern IDE features for OCaml.

Emacs and Vim support is provided out-of-the-box. To get editor support with Merlin in
other editors, see [this](#other-editors).

Easy Installation With opam
===========================

If you have a working [opam](https://opam.ocaml.org/) installation, install Merlin running the following two commands in terminal:

```shell
opam install merlin
opam user-setup install
```

[opam-user-setup](https://github.com/OCamlPro/opam-user-setup) takes care of configuring Emacs and Vim to make best use of your current install. You can also [configure the editor](#editor-setup) yourself, if you prefer.

Manually Building and Installing Merlin
=======================================

Since version 4.0, Merlin's repository has a dedicated branch for each version of
OCaml, and the branch name consists of the concatenation of OCaml major versions
and minor versions. So, for instance, `OCaml 4.11.*` maps to branch `411`.
The main branch is usually synchronised with the branch compatible with the
latest (almost-)released version of OCaml.

Note: if you're using an older version of OCaml (between 4.02 and 4.10), you will
want to build the 3.4 branch, although it won't contain the most recent
features.

Compilation
-----------

Dependencies: `ocamlfind`, `yojson` >= 2.0.0, `dune` >= 2.7.

```shell
dune build -p dot-merlin-reader,merlin
```

Note: if you want to work on Merlin, you'll want to avoid the `-p merlin` to
build in dev mode, with some extra warnings enabled. In that case, you'll also
need an extra dependency: Menhir.

Installation
------------

If you haven't encountered any errors in the previous step, just run:

```shell
dune install -p dot-merlin-reader,merlin
```

You can pass an explicit prefix to Dune, using `--prefix`. It defaults to
your current opam switch.

Editor Setup
============

To set up Emacs and Vim, you need to instruct them to run the appropriate script when an OCaml file is opened.

In the rest of the document, \<SHARE\_DIR\> refers to the directory where Merlin data files are installed.

It will usually be:

- printed by the command `opam var share`, if you used opam
- "\<prefix\>/share" if you explicitly specified a prefix when configuring Merlin

### Vim Setup

Makes sure that `ocamlmerlin` binary can be found in PATH.

The only setup needed is to have the following directory in the Vim runtime path (append this to your `.vimrc`):

    :set rtp+=<SHARE_DIR>/merlin/vim

The default configuration can be seen in:

    <SHARE_DIR>/merlin/vim/plugin/merlin.vim

After adding Merlin to Vim's runtime path, you will probably want to run `:helptags <SHARE_DIR>/merlin/vim/doc` to register Merlin documentation inside Vim.

A more comprehensive documentation can be found on the [vim-from-scratch wiki](https://github.com/ocaml/merlin/wiki/vim-from-scratch).

### Emacs Setup

#### Manual Setup

Merlin comes with an Emacs library (file: emacs/merlin.el) that implements a *minor-mode* that is supposed to be used on top of *tuareg-mode*.

Just add the following to your *.emacs* file:

```emacs
(push "<SHARE_DIR>/emacs/site-lisp" load-path) ; directory containing merlin.el
(setq merlin-command "<BIN_DIR>/ocamlmerlin")  ; needed only if ocamlmerlin not already in your PATH
(autoload 'merlin-mode "merlin" "Merlin mode" t)
(add-hook 'tuareg-mode-hook #'merlin-mode)
(add-hook 'caml-mode-hook #'merlin-mode)
;; Uncomment these lines if you want to enable integration with the corresponding packages
;; (require 'merlin-iedit)       ; iedit.el editing of occurrences
;; (require 'merlin-company)     ; company.el completion
;; (require 'merlin-ac)          ; auto-complete.el completion
```

More comprehensive documentation can be found on the [emacs-from-scratch wiki](https://github.com/ocaml/merlin/wiki/emacs-from-scratch).

#### Setup via `package.el`

An installable core Merlin package is available via
[MELPA](https://melpa.org), along with further small integration
packages `merlin-company`, `merlin-iedit`, and `merlin-ac`, which users
can install according to their needs.

Having installed the required packages, the following code in your
Emacs startup file is sufficient:

```el
(setq merlin-command "<BIN_DIR>/ocamlmerlin")  ; needed only if ocamlmerlin not already in your PATH
(add-hook 'tuareg-mode-hook #'merlin-mode)
(add-hook 'caml-mode-hook #'merlin-mode)
;; Uncomment these lines if you want to enable integration with the corresponding packages
;; (require 'merlin-iedit)       ; iedit.el editing of occurrences
;; (require 'merlin-company)     ; company.el completion
;; (require 'merlin-ac)          ; auto-complete.el completion
```

### Other Editors

Merlin only supports Vim and Emacs out-of-the-box. This section describes shortly how to get
Merlin-based editor support in other editors.

#### Visual Studio Code

OCaml has official support for Visual Studio Code through an extension called "OCaml Platform," available in the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ocamllabs.ocaml-platform). Project source is available [here](https://github.com/ocamllabs/vscode-ocaml-platform).
*Note* that it requires [OCaml-LSP](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml-lsp), an official
[Language Server Protocol(LSP)](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/specification-current/)
implementation for OCaml based on Merlin. It can be installed by running `opam install ocaml-lsp-server`.

#### Editors Without Official Support

Consider using [OCaml-LSP](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml-lsp) along with your editor's
plugin for LSP if there is one.

The wiki also contains pages for:

- [Acme](https://github.com/ocaml/merlin/wiki/acme-from-scratch)
- [Atom](https://github.com/ocaml/merlin/wiki/atom-from-scratch)
- [Spacemacs](https://github.com/ocaml/merlin/wiki/spacemacs-from-scratch)

External contributors have implemented modes for more editors:

- [ocaml-merlin package for Atom](https://atom.io/packages/ocaml-merlin)
- [Nuclide for Atom](https://nuclide.io/) includes Merlin support
- [Sublime Text 3](https://github.com/cynddl/sublime-text-merlin)


Merlin as a library
===================

Merlin can also be used as a library. Some projects already rely on this:

- [OCaml LSP](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml-lsp) - The official OCaml's Language Server Protocol implementation

If you're building editor tools, you might also want to use Merlin as a library!

Note, however, that Merlin's public API is not stable, and we don't guarantee backward-compatibility between releases.
If you're a Merlin user and depend on our public API, we recommend that you contact us or open an issue.

Next Steps
==========

To use Merlin with a multi-file project, it is necessary to have a [.merlin](https://github.com/ocaml/merlin/wiki/project-configuration) file, 
unless your project is built using Dune.
Note that, in a project using Dune, user-created `.merlin` files will take precedence over the configuration provided by Dune to Merlin. 

Read more in the [wiki](https://github.com/ocaml/merlin/wiki) to learn how to make full use of Merlin in your projects.

### Reporting Issues

When you encounter an issue, please report it with as much detail as possible. A thorough bug report is always appreciated :)

Check that our issue database doesn't already include that problem/suggestion. You can click "subscribe" on issues to follow their progress and updates.

When reporting issues, please include:

- Steps to reproduce the problem, if possible with some code triggering the issue
- Version of the tools you are using: operating system, editor, OCaml

Try to be as specific as possible:

- Include the content of error messages if there are any.

If it seems relevant, also include information about your development environment:

- The opam version and switch in use
- Other toolchains involved (OCaml flavors, Cygwin, C compiler, shell, ...)
- How the editor was setup
