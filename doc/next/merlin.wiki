@let-def: this design document gathers requirements and ideas for the next
  version of merlin.  The purpose is to consolidate features that were added
  lately and cleanup legacy crufts.

== TL;DR ==

* simpler & stateless protocol
* pure implementation for reference
* performance added on top, memoization & asynchronicity
* traceability, log all decisions and print internal structures
* maintenability, minimize change to OCaml codebase

See [[RATIONALE]].

== Implementation ==

Merlin is split in three main components:

* [[Protocol]], communicates with outside world
* [[Kernel]], wraps the OCaml frontend
* [[Analysis]], answers specific questions on the codebase
