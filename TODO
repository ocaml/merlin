- Write documentation: - External API
  - VIM mode
  - EMACS mode ?
  - Internal design
- Move path management to a dedicated module
- Fix pretty printing of type variables
- Pretty(ugly)-print hacked parse-trees for debugging purposes
- Hack typer : give type (forall a. a) to unbound values and ill-typed expressions
  to extract as much information as possible.
- Rework handling of errors and warnings
- Editor integration : allow to retrieve definition boundary to improve synchronisation
